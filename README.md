# Ecosystem-simulation-using-simpy
 Simulate ecosystem dynamics: plants grow, herbivores eat plants, and predators hunt smaller organisms using SimPy in this ecosystem simulation.

Ecosystem Simulation with SimPy
This project implements a simple ecosystem simulation using SimPy, a process-based discrete-event simulation framework in Python. The simulation models the interactions between plants, herbivores, and predators within an ecosystem.

Features
Plants grow over time, increasing their size.
Herbivores eat plants to satisfy their hunger.
Predators hunt and eat smaller organisms.
Simulation environment manages interactions and time steps.
Getting Started
Install SimPy by running pip install simpy.
Open ecosystem.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook or compatible environment.
Adjust the parameters for the ecosystem (number of plants, herbivores, predators, etc.) as desired.
Execute the notebook to run the simulation and observe the organism status.
Customization
Modify the growth rate of plants, size thresholds for herbivores and predators, or introduce new organism types and interactions.
Experiment with different ecosystem scenarios and observe how the dynamics change.
Requirements
Python 3.x
SimPy
